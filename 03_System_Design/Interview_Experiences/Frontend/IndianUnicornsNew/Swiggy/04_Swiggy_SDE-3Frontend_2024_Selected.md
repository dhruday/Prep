  if (obj instanceof Date) return new Date(obj.getTime());
  if (obj instanceof RegExp) return new RegExp(obj.source, obj.flags);
  if (obj instanceof Map) {
    const map = new Map();
    visited.set(obj, map);
    obj.forEach((v, k) => map.set(deepClone(k, visited), deepClone(v, visited)));
    return map;
  }
  if (obj instanceof Set) {
    const set = new Set();
    visited.set(obj, set);
    obj.forEach(v => set.add(deepClone(v, visited)));
    return set;
  }

  const clone = Array.isArray(obj) ? [] : Object.create(Object.getPrototypeOf(obj));
  visited.set(obj, clone);
  for (const key of [...Object.keys(obj), ...Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(obj)]) {
    clone[key] = deepClone(obj[key], visited);
