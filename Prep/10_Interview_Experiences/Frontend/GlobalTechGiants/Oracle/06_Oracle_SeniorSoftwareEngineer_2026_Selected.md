```javascript

  #state = 'pending'; #value; #handlers = [];
  constructor(executor) {
    const resolve = (value) => {
      if (this.#state !== 'pending') return;
      this.#state = 'fulfilled'; this.#value = value;
      this.#handlers.forEach(h => h.onFulfilled(value));
    };
    const reject = (reason) => {
      if (this.#state !== 'pending') return;
      this.#state = 'rejected'; this.#value = reason;
      this.#handlers.forEach(h => h.onRejected(reason));
    };
    try { executor(resolve, reject); } catch (e) { reject(e); }
  }

  then(onFulfilled, onRejected) {
    return new MyPromise((resolve, reject) => {
      const handle = {
        onFulfilled: v => {
          try { resolve(typeof onFulfilled === 'function' ? onFulfilled(v) : v); }
          catch (e) { reject(e); }
        },
        onRejected: e => {
          try {
            if (typeof onRejected === 'function') resolve(onRejected(e));
            else reject(e);
          } catch (e2) { reject(e2); }
        }
      };
      if (this.#state === 'pending') this.#handlers.push(handle);
      else if (this.#state === 'fulfilled') queueMicrotask(() => handle.onFulfilled(this.#value));
      else queueMicrotask(() => handle.onRejected(this.#value));
    });
  }

  catch(fn) { return this.then(null, fn); }
  static resolve(v) { return new MyPromise(r => r(v)); }
  static reject(e) { return new MyPromise((_, r) => r(e)); }

  static all(promises) {
    return new MyPromise((resolve, reject) => {
      const results = []; let count = 0;
      const arr = [...promises];
      if (!arr.length) return resolve([]);
      arr.forEach((p, i) => MyPromise.resolve(p).then(v => {
        results[i] = v;
        if (++count === arr.length) resolve(results);
      }, reject));
    });
  }

  static race(promises) {
    return new MyPromise((resolve, reject) => {
      for (const p of promises) MyPromise.resolve(p).then(resolve, reject);
    });
  }
}
